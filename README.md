# jalali.c
`jalali.c` is a fork of http://www.farsiweb.info/jalali/jalali.c. It is part of Jalali, a Gregorian to Jalali and inverse date convertor.

`jalali.exe` is a very simple CLI application to print the current Jalali date in windows command prompt.

If the executable does not work for you or if you prefer to compile the C file yourself, you can use any C compiler.
